## Technologies
- NodeJS Server
- React for frontend UI (CSS maybe)
- JavaScript for client-side code and logics
- Github for version control
- Auth0 for logging in to the site with the Github Login
- MongoDB for database


## Outlines
We will use this dating app for github users to find others who would like to work and mingle together over past, current, or future projects. 
Using your github email, you will login and provide your information pertaining to your own projects.
This is not only a chance for you to meet others to find potential work partners for the future but maybe platonic or romantic interests in each other.
Using MongoDB, we will store data of the logged in user with their Github credentials and have them fill out certain preferences in what they find in a work or romantic partner.
Using React, we will supply a certain framework or layout design that is available to all users.



<br> A certain Form could be setting up a potential date with another user, if you want to work on code together or you want to grab some coffee.
A Results page would be a table or list that can show all the pending, upcoming, or completed dates or meetups for the user.
A logger can include a way to schedule events from the past or for the future.
